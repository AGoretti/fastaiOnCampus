Well, this mostly worked, despite Colm saying that ""you want the ""failed-disk"" *instead* of the second ""raid-disk"", not in addition to it"". I suppose that means instead of: > raiddev /dev/md0 > raid-level 1 > nr-raid-disks 2 > nr-spare-disks 0 > chunk-size 4 > persistent-superblock 1 > device /dev/hdg3 > raid-disk 0 > device /dev/hda5 > raid-disk 1 > > failed-disk 1 I should have had: > raiddev /dev/md0 > raid-level 1 > nr-raid-disks 2 > nr-spare-disks 0 > chunk-size 4 > persistent-superblock 1 > device /dev/hdg3 > raid-disk 0 > device /dev/hda5 > failed-disk 1 It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive after the raid-disk one :) Anyway. It's doesn't quite boot right, with /=/dev/md0 in fstab. On boot, I see: Partition check: hda: [PTBL] [2482/255/63] hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4 < hda5 > hdg: [PTBL] [2434/255/63] hdg1 hdg2 hdg3 floppy0: no floppy controllers found RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 4096K size 1024 blocksize ide-floppy driver 0.99.newide md: md driver 0.90.0 MAX_MD_DEVS=256, MD_SB_DISKS=27 md: Autodetecting RAID arrays.

Any ideas why ? My suspicion is that I've a lack of knowledge about how initrd works, so I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only, fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it. Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it to load the initrd ?

So we're all in agreement then. Except for Marc. So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs. solicited commercial email? I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that really reads like spam. Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent SA if they make spam look like this SCE. This kind of convergence of the two.... well, it stinks. We can kill SCE, or we can cripple identification of UCE. Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably harder. What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc is in the corpus for the GA? Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.

OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted, accordingly. As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD. cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b So, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that were not there before the branch: - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST. they were too lax and caused FPs - Matt's faster HTML parser - commented rules un-commented again - a doco fix for spamd and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday: - the INSTALL file ;) - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary - Added examples to -R docs - Added Habeas HIL lookup - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc. -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com (Christopher Davis) applied. - made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd, fixes bug 655 - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file with -u arg - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users will have to customise for themselves. Made many tests which trigger FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM. - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0 - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code catch additional types of web bugs - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move them to the compensation file)) - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html were triggering. - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing any nonspam matches) - raise some negative scores that are way too low - remove ""Friend"" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND and can match ""dear friend"" in middle of sentence too much - require ""Dear Friend"" to start the paragraph - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of different eval functions needed for HTML tests --j. -- 'Justin Mason' => { url => http://jmason.org/ , blog => http://taint.org/ } ------------------------------------------------------- This sf.net email is sponsored by: OSDN - Tired of that same old cell phone?

I was so poor growing up... if I wasn't a boy... I'd have had nothing to play with. 02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, ""Come on over; nobody's home."" I went over. Nobody was home. 03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel 04. One day I came home early from work... I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?"" He said ""Because you came home early."" 05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning... put a shirt on and button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom. 06. I was such an ugly kid... When I played in the sandbox, the cat kept covering me up. 07. I could tell my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and radio. 08. I was such an ugly baby... My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend. 09. I'm so ugly... My father carries around a picture of the kid who came with his wallet. 10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled through."" 11. I'm so ugly... My mother had morning sickness... AFTER I was born. 12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof. 13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can hide."" 14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday. 15. I'm so ugly... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd get. 16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and I look in the mirror... I feel like throwing up; What's wrong with me?"" He said... ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect."" 17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest. 18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff. 19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm. Last night he went on the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it. 20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control. 21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in the electric chair.",0

Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works. ""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same conference panel. I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd. The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines illegal activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement: Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000.... For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement. ... The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works. Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain"" even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder. The statute of limitations: 507. Limitations on actions (a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose. (b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued. The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year. I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've put them in the %description section. See for instance : http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80 Where you can see : Available rpmbuild rebuild options : --with : alsa --without : aalib lirc libdv arts The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly :-/ I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel package for all the Psyche kernels!!!

Has the tmpsweeper swept through /tmp removing alfred's ssh-agent directory in its wake? o Is /tmp a+rwxt? Does /dev/null exist? o Has alfred been messing with his TMPDIR envar? o What does lsof on his ssh-agent say? What about on alfio's? o What are the permissions on ~alfred and ~alfred/.ssh? o Does alfred's uid conflict with somebody else's? o Does alfred's $SSH_AGENT_PID correspond to his agent? alfio's? ) Wesley.

Even then, those relics were well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history. Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than $200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable. Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86. It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things. The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store, runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away from the Microsoft monopoly. ... - http://finance.lycos.com/home/news/story.asp?story=28928829",0

The technique works for input values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.",0

All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right? Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult & complicated as possible ;--) Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious hassle down the line. Only kidding but thats what I would do. CW ---------------- OK, Here's how to do it [1] ... While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken, beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and install the i386 versions. This will break one or two other packages since they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc. these packages will need to be reinstalled. So: 1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave 2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm 3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel 4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm This installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc. You'll be able to boot in a non 686 machine now. However, X is now broken as is kerberos. At least those are the two I noticed. Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will contain clues as to what else might be broken. To fix X and kerberos you need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to /etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work): 1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm 2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm fixes them. Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and sane. If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related. Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.

Since this thing will be on a sub 56k dialup, any remote admin will be strictly of the emergency variety. I plan to have the server mail me its logs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the admin will be done locally. Conor [1] ""it"" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD K6-x box. Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or duron chips). A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686. The solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions. -- Conor Daly Met Eireann, Glasnevin Hill, Dublin 9, Ireland Ph +353 1 8064276 Fax +353 1 8064247 ------------------------------------ bofh.irmet.ie running RedHat Linux 10:27am up 8 days, 23:57, 5 users, load average: 0.19, 0.30, 0.49 ********************************************************************** This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.
